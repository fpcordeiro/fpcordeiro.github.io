### Working Papers
- **College Quality and Tuition Subsidies in Equilibrium** _with [Alvaro Cox](https://www.alvarocox.com/)_ [Job Market Paper]
<span style="color:red">Draft coming soon!</span>
  >In this paper, we study how demand-side subsidies interact with the equilibrium level of price and quality in the higher education sector in Brazil. More precisely, we consider two policies that help low-income students attend private institutions: scholarships and subsidized student loans. First, we develop a quality measure for undergraduate programs using value-added models, where a post-graduation outcome is determined by students' pre-enrollment characteristics. To do so, we leverage a rich administrative data environment and use student-level data linked through multiple datasets. We consider two post-graduation outcomes: a standardized ``exit" exam, which tests students' major-specific knowledge, and income data from a matched employer-employee database. We document key patterns and correlations of our quality measure and extensively validate it. Next, we use this quality measure in a model with demand and supply sides to understand how quality and price are determined in equilibrium. We consider two counterfactuals: decreasing the supply of loans by 10\% and decreasing the supply of scholarships by 10\%. We find similar patterns under both scenarios but much stronger effects for scholarships.

### Work in Progress
- **Ownership Effect on Productivity and Investment: Water Utilities in Brazil** _with Rodrigo Naumann_
  >Access to treated water and sanitation is essential for public health and economic development. However, many developing countries still face the challenge of serving a large fraction of their population. This project investigates how a water utility's ownership type, i.e., private or public, affects its productivity and incentives for coverage expansion. First, we use a panel of municipalities to run an event-study analysis of municipalities who switched their operators from public to private. We find that switchers were substantially more diligent in charging customers as they sharply increased the number of meters and fraction of billed water. Moreover, municipalities that switched to private operators show a substantial increase in new connections to treated water networks but without a sizeable increase in average price. Next, we propose a production function model that incorporates the firm's ownership type. In our model, we posit that utilities value a combination of profits and non-pecuniary benefits to rationalize their choice and allow such valuation to vary by ownership type. We also investigate how the ownership type affects the flexible input choices and unobserved productivity.
